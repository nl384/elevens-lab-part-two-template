# ArrayList Practice

In this assignment, you'll be writing three methods related to ArrayLists. 

The first method is countOdd(). This method takes an ArrayList\<Integer\> as input and returns the number of odd numbers in the ArrayList. The method should have the following signature:
```shell script
public static int countOdd(ArrayList<Integer> list) { }
```

The next method is checkDuplicates(). This method takes two ArrayList\<Integer\> as input and returns true if there is a number that appears in both ArrayLists.
```shell script
public static boolean checkDuplicates(ArrayList<Integer> list1, ArrayList<Integer> list2) { }
```

Finally, the last method is convertToArrayList(). This method takes an int[] as input and returns an ArrayList\<Integer\> contaiining the values from the int[].
```shell script
public static ArrayList<Integer> convertToArrayList(int[] arr) { }
```

Add code to [MyMain.java](src/main/java/MyMain.java) to do the desired thing.

## Run your code with:
```shell script
make run
```

## Run your tests with:
```shell script
make test
